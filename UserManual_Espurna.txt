/21stHome/switch/{identifier}

This is the root topic for this device. A trailing slash will be added if not preset. The {identifier} placeholder will be replaces by the device hostname.

- <root/>relay/# 

Send a 0 or a 1 as a payload to this topic to switch it on or off. You can also send a 2 to toggle its current state. 
Replace # with the switch ID (starting from 0). If the board has only one switch it will be 0.

- <root/>led/# 
Send a 0 or a 1 as a payload to this topic to set the onboard LED to the given state, send a 3 to turn it back to WIFI indicator. 
Replace # with the LED ID (starting from 0). If the board has only one LED it will be 0.

- <root/>button/# 
For each button in the board subscribe to this topic to know when it is pressed (payload 1) or released (payload 0).

- <root/>status The device will report a 1 to this topic every few minutes. Upon MQTT disconnecting this will be set to 0.

- Other values reported (depending on the build) are: firmware and version, hostname, IP, MAC, signal strenth (RSSI), uptime (in seconds), free heap and power supply.
